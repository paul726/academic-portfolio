# 🎓 Academic Portfolio — Independent Learning Record

Welcome to my academic learning archive. This repository documents my journey as a non-traditional learner preparing to apply for the Yale Eli Whitney Students Program (Fall 2026).

Here, I showcase the courses I’ve self-studied, the projects I’ve completed, and the reflections I’ve written along the way — across computer science, mathematics, and the humanities.

## 📘 MIT 6.824: Distributed Systems

This folder contains my implementation of key distributed systems concepts as taught in [MIT's graduate-level course 6.824](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/).

### Labs Completed:
- ✅ Lab 1: Raft Leader Election
- ⏳ Lab 2: Raft Log Replication
- ⏳ Lab 3: Key-Value Store & Fault Tolerance
- ⏳ Lab 4: MapReduce Engine

Each lab folder includes:
- Source code (Go)
- Testing logs / outputs
- A personal reflection on what I learned

## 📐 Math Notes (Based on MIT 6.042J)

Notes and exercises based on **Mathematics for Computer Science**, an MIT undergraduate course (6.042J) covering:
- Logic
- Set Theory
- Graphs
- Combinatorics
- Probability

These notes demonstrate my logical reasoning, proof writing, and abstract thinking ability.

## ✍️ Justice Journal (Writing-Intensive Course Reflections)

Short essays and philosophical reflections written while following **Harvard's “Justice” course by Michael Sandel** (edX). Topics include:
- Utilitarianism vs Libertarianism
- Rawlsian fairness
- Ethics in technology and society

Each essay is concise (~300–500 words) and meant to show my ability to engage with abstract ideas and express structured arguments.

## 💡 Why This Portfolio Exists

As an adult learner returning to formal academics, I wanted to demonstrate not just my curiosity, but my academic readiness — through real work, not just words.

This portfolio is:
- 📂 Transparent (all work is visible and versioned)
- ✍️ Structured (each component reflects a learning goal)
- 🧠 Honest (it reflects who I am, not just what I know)

I hope this project reflects my deep motivation to learn, contribute, and grow — both as a future Yale student and as a lifelong thinker.

Thank you for visiting.
